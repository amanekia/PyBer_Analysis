# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview of The Analysis
In this project we were given data from PyBer (a ride sharing app) and were told to do some exploratory analysis. We had to use our python skills and knowledge of pandas to create a DataFrame of the ride sharing data by city type and then create a multi line graph that shows the total weekly fares for each city type.

## Results
This is the DataFrame that was generated

## Summary
Looking at the data we can see that in urban areas there is a surplus of drivers, so there are more drivers than passengers so the drivers end up making a lot less per ride compared to drivers in the rural and suburban areas.
